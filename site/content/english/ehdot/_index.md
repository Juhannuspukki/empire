title: Terms of payment and use

---

The parties to this contract are Tmi Annika Kartano (business ID 2495280-7), (“the Lessor”), and the company, entity, or person who has booked the right to use the premises using the Slotti.fi website (“the Lessee”).

By making a reservation you accept these terms.

* By booking the right to use the premises on the Slotti.fi website, you commit to paying the fee immediately. The available payment methods are online bank payment or card payment.

* The right to use the premises is temporary and it does not constitute a lease relationship as referred to in the Finnish Act on Commercial Leases.

* Companies may request an invoice for paying the fee. In the case of reservations that are invoiced, the Lessor, and not the Lessee, always makes the reservation.

* You may modify your reservation at no extra cost up to 12 hours before your reservation begins. When making a reservation, the Lessee receives an automated confirmation of reservation, with a link to the page where you may modify your reservation.

* Any cancellations must be made at least 24 hours before the reservation begins; otherwise, 50% of the reservation fee will be payable. The refund will be made within a reasonable time. Interest will not be paid on refunds.

* When making a reservation, the Lessee receives an automated confirmation of reservation, with a link to the page where he/she may cancel his/her reservation.

* The facilities are equipped with a smart locking system. When making a reservation, you will receive an SMS with an access code and instructions for accessing the premises. Each Lessee receives a unique code that is only valid for the duration of his/her reservation. Please note that the smart locking system notifies the Lessor if the door remains open for longer than 10 minutes at a time. Keep the door closed and locked during your reservation. Make sure to close and lock the door properly when leaving the premises.

* It is forbidden to disclose the access code to third parties.

* You must leave the premises within 10 minutes of the end of your reserved time slot. Another reservation may begin immediately after your reservation, and the premises must be available for the next lessee.

* The Lessee is responsible for reserving a sufficiently long slot, leaving the studio clean and tidy, and for leaving the premises by the end of the reserved time slot.

* If you do not leave the premises within 10 minutes of the end of your reserved time slot, you will be charged the full price (EUR 65, incl. VAT) of the following hour. By accepting these terms you agree to leave the studio clean and tidy for the next lessee and commit to making sure that you have enough time for tidying up the premises. If necessary, we will have the premises cleaned at the Lessee’s expense.
